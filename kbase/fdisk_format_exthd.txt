to format external USB ext hd:

* run fdisk -l to check the device's /dev/theusbdisk file.
* fdisk /dev/theusbdisk  --->   delete all partitions and create a new one
* then mkfs.ext3 /dev/theusbdiskfile#    <--- ATTENTION! do this on the device plus partition number. for example /dev/sdb1 <--- notice the 1!
* then e2label /dev/theusbdisk# THEPARTITIONNAME     ---->    AGAIN, use the device plus partition number (/dev/sdb1 for example)
* then blkid /dev/theusbdisk# to get the partition's uuid so it can be added to the fstab (yes, add the device plus number)
* like so: "UUID=6f6aafa8-7dce-46f2-89e5-0b8908d6d1e6        /home/mateus/Mountpoints/AcervoBK               ext3           rw,noauto,owner,users,nobootwait               0       0" <- an actual line from my fstab from early 2015, on a linux mint 17
* then chown the mount point to the user to make sure they can mount it and rw it.
* check your new mountpoint. it might have a lost+found folder inside. get rid of it.
